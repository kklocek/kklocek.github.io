Here are listed some of my side projects, mainly games.. I created my first game when I was 11 (The Games Factory 1.6 was a nice software!), after that I developed some platform games in the Game Maker 6.0. After many breaks I got back into game dev on university.

If you are interested in my other work check my GitHub account [here](https://github.com/kklocek).
